    <h2 id="answers">Why did we pick to do the game Snake?</h2>
    <p>Our first thought, when geting assignesd this task was, 
    what is a game that everyone seems to enjoy and likes to play when bored. Well, throught this whole school
    year our class has bonded over many things. One of them includong PC games. When a lection got cancelled,
    or when we were siiting in classrooms during winter, or even during the 5 minute breaks; a game that was
    most played throught this whole year was Snake. SO as a group we decided to recreate Snake and add our own
    touch to it.</p>
