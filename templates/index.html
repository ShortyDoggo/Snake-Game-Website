    <h5>Trixie, Tim & Elion</h5>
    <p>Welcome to our website.</p>
    
    <h2>Why did we pick to do the game Snake?</h2>
    <p>Our first thought, when getting assigned this task was, 
    what is a game that everyone seems to enjoy and likes to play when bored? Well, throught this whole school
    year our class has bonded over many things. One of them includong PC games. When a lection got cancelled,
    or when we were sitting in classrooms during winter, or even during the 5 minute breaks; a game that was
    most played throughout this whole year was Snake. So as a group we decided to recreate Snake and add our own
    touch to it. 
    Eventhough we struggled at the beginning and had never previously attempted something like this before, it 
    was quite an enlightening experience. We learned a lot of new ways to make things work, with the help of
    watching a lot of videos.    </p>

    <h2>About the Game</h2>
    <h4> Rules of the game:</h4>
        <ul>1.	The game screen has a fixed width and height.</ul>
        <ul>2.	The game starts with the snake and food fixed at certain positions.</ul>
        <ul>3.	The snake changes direction as the user presses specific keys, e.g., W, A, S, D or Up, Left, Down, Right.</ul>
        <ul>4.	Once in motion (after the user presses a key), the snake keeps on moving in the said direction till the user presses another key.</ul>
        <ul>5.	The score (points) starts at zero and increases as the snake eats food.</ul><br>
